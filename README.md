# Notes

## Abstract

I'm not a developer, why should I use git? My whole shop is using git now, but I
don't get it. It just makes my workflow harder. We're just a small team. Me and
a couple others. Why do I need source control? If any of these sound familiar I
think I have some answers for you. Software is still in the process of eating
the world, but source control has already eaten devops. Source control is one of
the critical technologies that enables most of the devops tools and practices
that enable us to move faster. The only problem is that in far too many shops,
the ops people are either struggling with the change, or they aren't even trying
because they don't see the benefit. But operations is in the title! We should be
participating in the revolution! So come see if I can convince you of the
benefit and show you a little bit of how you can do it. I'll cover a some of the
why, but mostly I'll be doing practical examples and demos to show you how you
can stop emailing your scripts around, stop mapping shared drives with your
scripts in them, and start letting the tools help you collaborate with your
teammates.
